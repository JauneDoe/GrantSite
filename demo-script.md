 # Website Demo Walkthrough Script
**For: Grant Consultancy Client Presentation**

## 1. Introduction
"Hi [Client Name], today I'm going to walk you through the new custom built digital platform for your Grant Consultancy. We've built this to handle three main things for you:
1.  **Attract Clients:** A professional public face that explains your value.
2.  **Streamline Intake:** A client portal where businesses can apply and track their status.
3.  **Simplify Management:** An admin dashboard for you to manage those requests and easily edit the website without code."

## 2. The Public Experience (Landing Page)
**Action:** Open `index.html` (Home Page).

**Talking Points:**
*   "This is what the public sees. We've framed the language around 'Grant Consulting' and 'Getting Qualified'."
*   **Hero Section:** "Clear call to action immediately. 'Get Qualified' leads them to register."
*   **Funds Secured Tracker:** "Scroll down slightly. We have a live progress bar showing how much funding you've secured. This builds trust instantly."
*   **Customizable:** "Every piece of text, the colors, and the images you see here can be changed by you in seconds, which I'll show you at the end."

---

## 3. The Client Experience (Registration & Dashboard)
**Action:** Click the "Get Qualified" or "Client Portal" button (or navigate to `client-register.html`).

**Step A: Registration**
*   "Let's pretend I'm a small business owner named 'Alex' who needs funding."
*   "I click register. notice we ask for **EIN** and **Organization Name**—this ensures you get serious inquiries."
*   *(Fill out the form with dummy data and click 'Create Account')*

**Step B: The Dashboard (`client-dashboard.html`)**
*   "Once registered, I land here—my private Client Dashboard."
*   **Intake Form:** "On the left, I have a simple form to submitting a new funding request. I'll ask for $50,000 for 'Startup Capital'." *(Submit the form)*.
*   **Status Tracking:** "On the right (or bottom), I can see my application status is now **'Received'**. This stops clients from calling you constantly just to ask 'did you get my application?'—they can just check here."

---

## 4. The Admin Experience (Owner Portal)
**Action:** Open `login.html` (or sign out). Log in with:
*   **Username:** `Owner`
*   **Password:** `Easyas123`

**Step A: The Admin Dashboard (`owner.html`)**
*   "Now, I'm logging in as **YOU** (the Owner)."
*   "Welcome to your Admin Portal. It's clean, modern, and focused."

**Step B: CRM / Client Request Management**
*   **Action:** Click the **"Client Requests"** tab.
*   "Look right here. You can see the request 'Alex' just submitted for $50,000."
*   "You can view the details. Let's say you've reviewed it and it looks good. You can change the status from **'Received'** to **'Reviewing'** or **'Approved'**."
*   "Or, if you need more info (like missing tax docs), you can set it to **'Action Needed'** and click **'Start Chat'**. You can send a direct message like 'Please upload your 2024 returns'."
*   *(Change the status to 'Reviewing' in the dropdown).*
*   "When you do this, if Alex logs back into his dashboard, he sees the new status and clicks **'View Messages'** to reply to you directly."

## 5. Total Control (The Website Editor)
**Action:** In the Sidebar, click **"Website Editor"** (opens `editor.html`).

**Talking Points:**
*   "Finally, we know your business evolves. You shouldn't need to hire a developer just to change a sentence or a photo."
*   "This is your dedicated **Website Editor**."
    *   **Colors:** "Want to rebrand? Click 'Theme & Colors' and pick a new primary color."
    *   **Text:** "Want to change the headline? Just type it here."
    *   **Photos:** "Open the 'Community Impact' section. You can paste new image links and change the captions yourself."
*   "Hit 'Save', and the public website is instantly updated."

## 6. Closing / Feedback
"So, we have a complete loop: **New clients find you -> They apply online -> You manage them in your dashboard.**"

"Why don't you take the link, try creating a test client account yourself, and let me know if there are any specific fields you want added to the intake form?"
